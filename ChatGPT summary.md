chatGPT is based on GPT-3. But it solve the misalign problem by using human feedback to guid the learning process with the goal of mitigating the model's
misalignment issues. The specific technique uses is called Reinforcement learning from Human feedback.
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.

#### How the reinforcement learning from human feedback work?
  1. supervised-learning
  2. fine-tune supervised learning
  3. mimic human preference: rank the SFT model output and set them as the input of reward model
  4. Fine-tuning the SFT model via Proximal Policy Optimization
#### main point
- reinforcement learning
- reward model
- Proximal Policy OPtimization
